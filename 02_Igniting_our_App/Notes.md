# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript, NPM & Bundler Concepts

## 1. What is NPM?
**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for **Node.js**.  
It helps install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries and tools.

## 2. What is Parcel / Webpack? Why do we need it?
**Parcel** and **Webpack** are module bundlers.  
They take multiple JS, CSS, and asset files and bundle them into optimized files for the browser.  
We need them for:
- Code optimization (minification, compression)
- Faster loading
- Dependency management
- Code splitting and browser compatibility

## 3. What is .parcel-cache?
A cache folder created by Parcel to store build data and speed up future builds.  
It can be deleted safely â€” Parcel will recreate it.

## 4. What is npx?
**NPX (Node Package Execute)** lets you run npm packages directly without installing them globally.

Example:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## 5. Difference between dependencies vs devDependencies
- dependencies: Required for the app to run in production (e.g., react, express).
- devDependencies: Required only during development/build/test (e.g., parcel, eslint).

## 6. What is Tree Shaking?
Tree shaking removes unused code from the final JavaScript bundle so only used exports are included â€” improving performance.

## 7. What is Hot Module Replacement (HMR)?
HMR allows live updates of modules in the browser without a full page reload. Useful during development to preserve state and speed feedback.

## 8. Parcel superpowers â€” top 5
1. Zero Configuration â€” works without setup.  
2. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) â€” instant updates on save.  
3. Tree Shaking â€” removes unused code automatically.  
4. Caching â€” .parcel-cache speeds up rebuilds.  
5. Auto Asset Optimization â€” compresses images, CSS, JS, etc.

Describe any 3:
- Zero Config: No webpack config file needed; Parcel works out-of-the-box.  
- HMR: Reflects code changes instantly without reloading the page.  
- Caching: Makes rebuilds fast by reusing previous compilations.

## 9. What is .gitignore? What to add / not add
.gitignore tells Git which files/folders to ignore.

Add (ignore):
- node_modules/
- .env
- .parcel-cache/
- dist/

Don't add:
- Source code (src/)
- package.json / package-lock.json
- Other necessary project files

## 10. Difference between package.json and package-lock.json
- package.json: Lists project metadata and dependency ranges.
- package-lock.json: Locks exact dependency versions to ensure consistent installs.

## 11. Why not modify package-lock.json manually?
It ensures version consistency. Manual edits can break dependency integrity and cause install/build issues.

## 12. What is node_modules? Should it be pushed to Git?
node_modules contains installed npm packages. Do not push it to Git â€” it's large and can be rebuilt with npm install.

## 13. What is the dist folder?
The dist (distribution) folder contains the final optimized build ready for deployment â€” generated by bundlers.

## 14. What is browserslist?
browserslist defines target browsers for the project. Tools like Babel, Autoprefixer, and Parcel use it to optimize compatibility.

Example entry in package.json:
```json
"browserslist": [
  ">0.2%",
  "not dead",
  "not op_mini all"
]
```

## 15. Read about different bundlers
- Vite â€” super-fast dev server using native ES modules.  
- Webpack â€” highly configurable and powerful.  
- Parcel â€” zero-config, beginner-friendly.

## 16. Read about ^ (caret) and ~ (tilde)
- ^ (caret): updates minor and patch versions (e.g., ^1.2.3 â†’ 1.3.0).  
- ~ (tilde): updates patch versions only (e.g., ~1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4).

## 17. Script types in HTML (MDN)
- async â€” loads script asynchronously; executes as soon as downloaded.  
- defer â€” loads in background; executes after HTML parsing.  
- default â€” blocks HTML parsing until the script is loaded and executed.
